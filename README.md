In the http-server library, when the user starts the server, it displays a nice
little message with all of the IP addresses where you can access the server.
It'd be really nice to be able to do this on Express as well. Students would
be able to show off their work to peers, test their web app on different devices,
and collaborate on the same running instance while pairing.
